Mental state checks to support health and wellness plans.

You can be OK. Follow your plan.

It can be hard to know what you need any given day. This app tries to help you track your mental needs, so your doctors can help you better.
   
This app is intended to be used as support for an action plan that you develop with support from medical professionals. The rating scales included here are ones you can use for free, because the researchers that built and tested them also shared them. See the license information for more details.

Don't use any of this for self-diagnosis, use a doctor. I checked the research to make sure these tests can support care after you know what's impacting you.

If you're not sure about something from one of these tests, ask and appropriate doctor or nurse for help. If you think you can't afford one, contact local public health services and see if they can direct you to help.

To Do:
- make into an installable portable web app, remove need to be online or have active phone plan after it is installed.
- clear/erase/zero button to clear out last-used responses, keep them from discovery by others.
- care plan triggers: input screen, pop-up if triggered.
- investigate adding security against creepers and abusers, especially for the health plan and trigger levels.
- security check, try to prevent this from running or embedded in an invasive environment.

To Avoid:
- self-diagnosis: no "default" triggers / state labels.
- responses being network accessible, or even saved.
- need to be online.

Motivating use case: support care plans developed for people in unstable situation, where follow-up is (for whatever reason, internal or external) unreliable. Should remind them of what to do if they enter a state of excessive anxiety, depression, mania, or other state identified by the users care providers as requiring activation of part of a care plan.
